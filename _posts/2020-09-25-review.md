# Project Description

The Shakespeare and Company Project is an archival collection of the records kept from Sylvia Beach’s English-language bookshop and lending library in Paris, France from 1919 to 1962 named “Shakespeare and Company.” It includes photocopies of membership cards, Beach’s logbook, photographs of the shop itself, and photographs of Sylvia Beach. Beyond simply exploring who used the library and what books were available via the membership cards, The Shakespeare and Company Project also offers insight into what life was like for the “Lost Generation” and English speakers living in France during that time. 

It embarks on a conversation about the history of that community during the time, and how influential its practice was. Besides providing resources to major authors, Beach’s library published James Joyce’s *Ulysses* while it was banned in the States, for instance.

# Project Review 

This project is well-funded and well-supported. It has an extensive team of researchers and technical assistants that are financially supported by a number of institutions within Princeton University including The Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton. Its website is implemented as a custom Python/Django web application that they have made available on GitHub. 

The site is easily navigated and accessible. Under every article, there is a “how to cite” citation for that page that utilizes MLA formatting. Moreover, all of the pages for this site are updated fairly regularly with the date listed at the top as to when that occurred and by whom. 

Every page offers hyperlinks to relevant websites that either confirm where evidence is found or offers more information about a certain topic. All but one, the link for an article on the Sacco and Vanzetti case, were open-access. That one required a subscription to The *New York Times* to view. This can easily be repaired by instead citing another article that is available to the public freely.

Although the project is clearly run and maintained by scholars within the various disciplines it employs, the language used within its informative articles is casual and engaging. The audience is by no means expected to be familiar with Shakespeare and Company. This is clear because on the project’s “about” page, a brief but thorough description is given about the library itself and also the aim of the project. 

There is no prior assumption of the authors that the audience who comes across this project should be well-versed in 20th century Parisian reading. Its links at the top of the opening page are that of household name American authors. Curiosity is meant to lure in the cat to explore the rest of the site and see what these famous authors have in common with Shakespeare and Company (especially in Paris of all places).

However, this is still meant to be an academic project. It is evident when a “contribution” you can make to the site is responding to their call for papers. 

Technical inclusions are a FAQ page, an accessibility troubleshooting link, and an active Twitter account. These assets are helpful and leaves the audience with the confident impression that this project is well managed. They could, however, describe the books in the collection along with brief bibliographical background notable members. Those who approach the project without an academic background may struggle with understanding the significance of them.
