# To Trigger your Memory

My project is focused on phase one of creating a virtual reality writing center. Phase one entails the layout of the digital center. All the fine details and role-playing aspects will be completed in further phases. With my budget being only $1,500, I am limited to just working through essentially the floorplan/blueprint of my virtual writing center in phase one.  

## Since Last Time…

One of my primary concerns since my last blog post was considering what the grant money would go towards. This investigation took a good amount of time to thoroughly look into and I found myself falling down the rabbit hole of virtual design. It was a bit intimidating and stressful weeding through the different kinds of software that are used for virtual reality design. After all, I’m just a humble philosophy student who has avoided all things computer-related her entire life. 

But I am glad I stumbled down that hole. Even though there was *a lot* there, it opened my eyes to exactly how dense the field of digital design is. I did wish I had someone holding my hand through this research though and pointing me in the right direction. I’m confident that the software I found is good (based on its reviews) yet I still worry it might not be the exact fit for my project. 

The software I decided on is called Unity Plus. From my understanding, it allows you to create a virtual world, or at least design the layout. Designing the layout is all that phase one of my project (and this grant) will be accomplishing.

I also included in my budget hiring a basic game developer. I estimated about 40 hours of work for them to complete the design. After researching the average amount of money that game developers make, I decided on $25 an hour for mine. The design is going to be very basic so high technical competencies shouldn’t be necessary (which would raise their wage). 

## The Grant Narrative

It’s been very helpful having multiple eyes look over my narrative through peer review. I’m pleased that none of my peers pointed out any glaring issues. The comments I have gotten back are more focused on organization and clarity. 

That being said, going forward, I anticipate making small adjustments here and there to tweak my narrative so that I answer any questions raised by my peers and organize it so that it follows a coherent, logical progression. My peer’s feedback has been extremely helpful in understanding the reader’s perspective. As the writer, everything seems crystal clear to me. It’s only when someone shows me a point of confusion or suggestion for revision that I realize my reader isn’t me. They can’t hop into my head and know exactly what I’m envisioning.

## My New Understanding of the Project

Going piece by piece for this grant has been very enlightening. I think it’s extremely helpful breaking down the different sections and working on the grant over the course of a few weeks. I have done a grant proposal in the past, but we worked on it all at once: one monstrous project. Going piece by piece is much more effective for me personally.

Moreover, doing individual sections has made me actually think through what exactly my project will be. It has required me to pay close attention to the fine details of my project. My project has come from just an idea in my head to an achievable reality because of the grant proposal. Spelling it out piece by piece through the grant has changed my perspective on my project in that I have a greater appreciation for its potential as well as a well-formed plan as to how it will become actualized.
