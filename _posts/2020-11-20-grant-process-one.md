# How's it Going?

My digital humanities project is to create a virtual reality (VR) writing center. Since this idea is too big for a $1,500 budget, I’m just going to be focusing on phase one: the initial design.

So far, I am excited that this project idea is new. It hasn’t been explored before, in the way that I’d like to explore it, by others in the field of writing center work. However, since the end product is much more expensive than the $1,500 budget,  I’m a little disappointed. I’d like to see my project come to fruition here and now, but the (theoretical) funds aren’t available. 

Yet, this does make my project expandable. By this, I mean that after this grant is used, the project won’t just stop and be stagnant. Rather, it will have so much room for further development. I’m excited about this since I know that grant committees look for potential development opportunities going onward. 

## The Idea of a Writing Center

I’ve always been familiar with the writing center. When I was in high school, I was briefly involved with my school’s center. Now, in college, I am currently enrolled in the course to train writing consultants. One of the main concerns with writing centers is how to adequately advertise that they are not a fix-it shop for bad writing. Actually, they’re where any level of a writer can go to *discuss and collaborate* on their writing with a trained consultant. 

Unfortunately, the misconception that they’re fix-it shops is pervasive and harmful to the writing center’s image. With my VR project, writers will be able to “test” out what a writing center is like virtually primarily through role-playing, like a video game. 

That’s the end goal at least. For now, it’s just going to be working on the skeleton of the VR platform. Other academic projects like this exist, an example is the Harlem VR project. However, there are none specifically about the writing center. I found this interesting since so much scholarship exists about how to break down the fix-it shop idea, yet nothing exists that creatively puts it into practice.

## Going Forward

As I’m sure you can probably tell at this point, I’m not too excited about starting at the very, very beginning of this grant proposal. What I really want to get into is creating the dialogue between writer and consultant in the role-playing part of the game. That comes later, though.

Because of my general hesitation and lack of excitement for working out the skeleton, I need to focus on it *more*. It will be the foundation for a well-designed project, which means I need to set my pride aside and start laying my bricks so there’s something to build on top of later. 

I really need to start thinking about what this skeleton is going to look like. I haven’t broken it down too much yet since I’m not overly thrilled to do this heavy lifting of laying bricks. I especially need to give thorough thought to my budget. I’m not familiar with how much these things cost, so I may be totally underestimating or overestimating what I can afford. 

Going forward, I just need to have a more focused approach to my project. I need to do some research into how much I can afford and what I can get done in a reasonable time frame. I’m still excited about the project, I just wish I had all the money in the world to get it done.
